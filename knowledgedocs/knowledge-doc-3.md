# Pathfinding Algorithms

Pathfinding algorithms are a staple in computer science, used to solve problems in fields ranging from video games to network routing to biological data analysis. These algorithms find the shortest or most efficient path between two points.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

`Dijkstra`'s algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It uses a priority queue to explore the node with the lowest cost first. It's efficient and works well for many problems, but it doesn't handle negative weights.

## A* Algorithm

The `A*` algorithm is another pathfinding algorithm that's widely used in games and robotics. It uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node, allowing it to explore less promising nodes less often. This makes it more efficient than `Dijkstra`'s algorithm for many problems.

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that can handle negative weights. It works by relaxing edges and updating costs iteratively. However, it's less efficient than `Dijkstra`'s and `A*` for problems without negative weights.

## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

The `Floyd-Warshall` algorithm is a different kind of pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes. It's less efficient for single-source problems, but it's the best choice when you need to solve many related problems at once.

## Greedy Best-First Search

`Greedy Best-First Search` is a pathfinding algorithm that uses a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal from a given node and explores the most promising node first. However, it's not guaranteed to find the shortest path.
