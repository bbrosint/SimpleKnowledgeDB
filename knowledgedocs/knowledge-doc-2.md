# Machine Learning

*Machine Learning* is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that provides systems the ability to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, we have a dataset consisting of both features and labels. The goal is to construct an estimator which is able to predict the label of an object given the set of features. A wide range of supervised learning algorithms are available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. There is no single learning algorithm that works best on all supervised learning problems.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning addresses a different sort of problem. Here the data has no labels, and we are interested in finding similarities between the objects in question. In a sense, you can think of unsupervised learning as a means of discovering labels from the data itself. Unsupervised learning comprises tasks such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and density estimation.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a type of *Machine Learning* which allows software agents and machines to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context, to maximize its performance. Simple reward feedback is required for the agent to learn its behavior; this is known as the reinforcement signal.

## Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Networks are a specific set of algorithms that have revolutionized *Machine Learning*. They are inspired by biological neural networks and the current so called deep neural networks have proven to work quite well.

## Overfitting and Underfitting

Overfitting occurs when the model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. Underfitting refers to a model that can neither model the training data nor generalize to new data.

## Evaluation Metrics

Evaluation metrics explain the performance of a model. An important aspect in the field of *Machine Learning* is the metrics used to evaluate the model. The choice of metrics influences how the performance of *Machine Learning* algorithms is measured and compared.

## Conclusion

*Machine Learning* is an exciting field of computer science that has the potential to transform the way we live and work. As *Machine Learning* algorithms become more sophisticated, we can expect to see even more innovative uses for this technology in the future.
