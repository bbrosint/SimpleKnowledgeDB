## Types of Networks

There are several types of networks, including Local Area Networks (`LAN`s), Wide Area Networks (`WAN`s), Personal Area Networks (`PAN`s), and Metropolitan Area Networks (`MAN`s).

## Network Topologies

Network topologies describe the arrangement of various elements in a network. Common topologies include *bus*, *ring*, *star*, *tree*, and *mesh*.

## Network Protocols

Network protocols define the rules for communication between devices on a network. Examples include `HTTP`, `TCP/IP`, `FTP`, and `SMTP`.

## Network Security

Network security involves protecting a network from unauthorized access, misuse, malfunction, modification, destruction, or improper disclosure.

## Wireless Networks

Wireless networks use radio waves or infrared signals to communicate, eliminating the need for wired connections. Examples include *Wi-Fi* and *Bluetooth* networks.

## Conclusion

Networks play a crucial role in connecting people and devices. As technology continues to evolve, networks will become increasingly complex and integral to our lives.
